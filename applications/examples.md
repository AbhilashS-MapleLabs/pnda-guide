# Example Applications

Some example applications have been written to help with getting started using PNDA and knowing what to put in an application package.

## Spark Batch

The [example-spark-batch](../repos/example-spark-batch/README.md) example converts data from the master data set into parquet format.

## Spark Streaming - Kafka to HBase

The [example-spark-streaming](../repos/example-spark-streaming/README.md) example writes data from Kafka into an HBase table.

The [Spark Streaming and HBase tutorial](ksh.md) provides an in-depth look at the app.

## Spark Streaming - Kafka to OpenTSDB

The [example-kafka-spark-opentsdb-app](../repos/example-kafka-spark-opentsdb-app/README.md) example writes data from Kafka in [OpenTSDB](../timeseries/opentsdb.md) metric time series.

The [Spark Streaming and OpenTSDB tutorial](kso.md) provides an in-depth look at the app.
